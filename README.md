# Maverick Reolink Viewer

A Home Assistant companion for Reolink cameras that are already set up in the
built-in [Reolink integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/reolink/):

- every device detail and every setting the integration exposes, with plain-language
  explanations of what each one does
- an event timeline for NVR / SD-card recordings with the camera's own AI detections
  (person, vehicle, animal, face, package, visitor, ...) and recording thumbnails
- smooth recorded-video playback and low-latency live view

**Status: planning.** No code yet.
