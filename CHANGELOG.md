# Changelog

What each release of Reolink Viewer brings. A release's notes on GitHub are its
entry here.

## 0.31.0

The first release through HACS. Reolink Viewer adds a **Reolink** panel to Home
Assistant's sidebar for the cameras, NVRs and Home Hubs set up in Home Assistant's
Reolink integration:

- **Live:** every camera on one board, each starting from its last picture; full
  screen in HD; picture-in-picture; the camera's own controls (pan and tilt, zoom,
  presets, floodlight, siren).
- **Events:** today's events from every camera as a timetable under the board, and
  any day's in the Events tab, filtered by camera and by what was seen.
- **Recordings:** each day on a timeline with the camera's own detections and
  thumbnails, from the NVR or the camera's SD card, in HD or SD, slow or fast.
- **Devices and settings:** every detail and setting the Reolink integration has,
  each explained in plain words.
- **Checks:** a live check, a playback check and a 24-hour soak report say in plain
  words how well it works on your devices, and what to do when it does not.
- On a computer and in the Home Assistant app on a phone, light and dark, from the
  keyboard and with a screen reader.

New in this release:

- Each release comes packaged: for HACS, and as `reolink_viewer.zip` to install by
  hand.
- Tested on every Home Assistant release from 2026.10.0 to 2026.10.4; a weekly
  check tries the newest.

Earlier versions were not released; the
[README](https://github.com/ambient-home-systems/Maverick-Reolink-Viewer#readme) says
what each one added.
